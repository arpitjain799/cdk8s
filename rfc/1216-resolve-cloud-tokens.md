Users can now author cdk8s applications that rely on cloud
resources defined with the AWS CDK or the CDK For Terraform.

## Working Backwards

### CHANGELOG

`feat(synth): fetch concrete values of AWS CDK and CDKTF tokens`

### README

It is common for Kubernetes applications to leverage cloud resources for their operation.
For example, a Kubernetes `CronJob` may need an S3 `Bucket` to store computation results,
or a Kubernetes `Deployment` might need a managed database like `DynamoDB` to
store application data. To achieve this, information such as the bucket
or table name needs to be passed into the Kubernetes resource definitions.
When this information is known during synthesis (for example by explicitly
setting the name of the bucket), this is trivial. However, when the information is
only available after provisioning the cloud resources, an additional lookup
phase is required in order to produce the Kubernetes manifest.

Lets look at an example. This application uses the AWS CDK to create an S3 bucket,
and passes the bucket name to a Kubernetes `CronJob`.

```ts
import * as aws from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as k8s from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-26';

const k8sApp = new k8s.App();
const awsApp = new aws.App();

const stack = new aws.Stack(awsApp, 'Stack');
const manifest = new k8s.Chart(k8sApp, 'Manifest');

const bucket = new aws.aws_s3.Bucket(stack, 'Bucket');
new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
  schedule: k8s.Cron.daily(),
  containers: [{
    image: 'job',
    envVariables: {
      // passing the bucket name via an env variable
      BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucket.bucketName),
    }
 }]
});

k8sApp.synth();
awsApp.synth();
```

> Note that for brevity, both the AWS CDK application and the cdk8s application
> are defined in the same file, but this doesn't have to be the case.

In this application, the name of the bucket will be generated by CloudFormation
(because it is not explicitly set), and will therefore only be available after
the bucket is provisioned. Naively synthesizing this application will produce a
non deployable Kubernetes manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: manifest-cronjob-c86481e8
spec:
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            cdk8s.io/metadata.addr: Manifest-CronJob-c89809bc
        spec:
          containers:
            - env:
                - name: BUCKET_NAME
                  value: ${Token[TOKEN.603]} # whoops, no good.
              image: job
```

Notice the value of the `BUCKET_NAME` env variable is `${Token[TOKEN.603]}`,
which is the string representation of an AWS CDK token, but has no
meaning in the context of Kubernetes. To address this, you can set the `resolveAwsCDKTokens`
property to `true` when synthesizing the cdk8s application:

```ts
...
k8sApp.synth({ resolveAwsCDKTokens: true });
...
```

Enabling this property will cause cdk8s to perform a lookup when it
encounters an AWS CDK token, resolving it to its concrete value, and
producing a valid manifest.

The same thing can also be achieved with the CDK For Terraform, by
setting the `resolveCDKTFTokens` to `true`.

```ts
import * as tf from "cdktf";
import * as aws from "@cdktf/provider-aws";
import * as k8s from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-26';

const k8sApp = new k8s.App();
const awsApp = new tf.App();

const stack = new tf.TerraformStack(awsApp, 'Stack');
const manifest = new k8s.Chart(k8sApp, 'Manifest');

const bucket = new aws.s3Bucket.S3Bucket(stack, 'Bucket');
new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
  schedule: k8s.Cron.daily(),
  containers: [{
    image: 'job',
    envVariables: {
      // passing the bucket name via an env variable
      BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucket.bucket),
    }
 }]
});

k8sApp.synth({ resolveCDKTFTokens: true });
awsApp.synth();
```

Note that enabling this functionality means that:

1. `cdk8s synth` must be executed after the cloud resources have been provisioned.
2. `cdk8s synth` must be executed in an environment that has connectivity
and permissions to query cloud resources.

## Public FAQ

> This section should include answers to questions readers will likely ask about
> this release. Similar to the "working backwards", this section should be
> written in a language as if the feature is now released.
>
> The template includes a some common questions, feel free to add any questions
> that might be relevant to this feature or omit questions that you feel are not
> applicable.

### What are we launching today?

> What exactly are we launching? Is this a new feature in an existing module? A
> new module? A whole framework? A change in the CLI?

### Why should I use this feature?

> Describe use cases that are addressed by this feature.

## Internal FAQ

> The goal of this section is to help decide if this RFC should be implemented.
> It should include answers to questions that the team is likely ask. Contrary
> to the rest of the RFC, answers should be written "from the present" and
> likely discuss design approach, implementation plans, alternative considered
> and other considerations that will help decide if this RFC should be
> implemented.

### Why are we doing this?

> What is the motivation for this change?

### Why should we _not_ do this?

> Is there a way to address this use case with the current product? What are the
> downsides of implementing this feature?

### What is the technical solution (design) of this feature?

> Briefly describe the high-level design approach for implementing this feature.
>
> As appropriate, you can add an appendix with a more detailed design document.
>
> This is a good place to reference a prototype or proof of concept, which is
> highly recommended for most RFCs.

### Is this a breaking change?

> If the answer is no. Otherwise:
>
> Describe what ways did you consider to deliver this without breaking users?
>
> Make sure to include a `BREAKING CHANGE` clause under the CHANGELOG section with a description of the breaking
> changes and the migration path.

### What alternative solutions did you consider?

> Briefly describe alternative approaches that you considered. If there are
> hairy details, include them in an appendix.

### What are the drawbacks of this solution?

> Describe any problems/risks that can be introduced if we implement this RFC.

### What is the high-level project plan?

> Describe your plan on how to deliver this feature from prototyping to GA.
> Especially think about how to "bake" it in the open and get constant feedback
> from users before you stabilize the APIs.
>
> If you have a project board with your implementation plan, this is a good
> place to link to it.

### Are there any open issues that need to be addressed later?

> Describe any major open issues that this RFC did not take into account. Once
> the RFC is approved, create GitHub issues for these issues and update this RFC
> of the project board with these issue IDs.

## Appendix

Feel free to add any number of appendices as you see fit. Appendices are
expected to allow readers to dive deeper to certain sections if they like. For
example, you can include an appendix which describes the detailed design of an
algorithm and reference it from the FAQ.
