`feat(synth): fetch concrete values of AWS CDK and CDKTF tokens`

### README

It is common for Kubernetes applications to leverage cloud resources for their operation.
For example, a Kubernetes `CronJob` may need an S3 `Bucket` to store computation results,
or a Kubernetes `Deployment` might need a managed database like `DynamoDB` to
store application data. To achieve this, information such as the bucket
or table name needs to be passed into the Kubernetes resource definitions.
When this information is known during synthesis (for example by explicitly
setting the name of the bucket), this is trivial. However, when the information is
only available after provisioning the cloud resources, an additional lookup
phase is required in order to produce the Kubernetes manifest.

Lets look at an example. This application uses the AWS CDK to create an S3 bucket,
and passes the bucket name to a Kubernetes `CronJob`.

```ts
import * as aws from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as k8s from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-26';

const awsApp = new aws.App();
const stack = new aws.Stack(awsApp, 'Stack');

const k8sApp = new k8s.App();
const manifest = new k8s.Chart(k8sApp, 'Manifest');

const bucket = new aws.aws_s3.Bucket(stack, 'Bucket');
new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
  schedule: k8s.Cron.daily(),
  containers: [{
    image: 'job',
    envVariables: {
      // passing the bucket name via an env variable
      BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucket.bucketName),
    }
 }]
});

awsApp.synth();
k8sApp.synth();
```

> Note that for brevity, both the AWS CDK application and the cdk8s application
> are defined in the same file, but this doesn't have to be the case.

In this application, the name of the bucket will be generated by CloudFormation
(because it is not explicitly set), and will therefore only be available after
the bucket is provisioned. Naively synthesizing this application will produce a
non deployable Kubernetes manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: manifest-cronjob-c86481e8
spec:
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            cdk8s.io/metadata.addr: Manifest-CronJob-c89809bc
        spec:
          containers:
            - env:
                - name: BUCKET_NAME
                  value: ${Token[TOKEN.603]} # whoops, no good.
              image: job
```

Notice the value of the `BUCKET_NAME` env variable is `${Token[TOKEN.603]}`,
which is the string representation of an AWS CDK token, but has no
meaning in the context of Kubernetes. To address this, you can set the `resolveAwsCDKTokens`
property to `true` when synthesizing the cdk8s application:

```ts
...
k8sApp.synth({ resolveAwsCDKTokens: true });
...
```

Enabling this property will cause cdk8s to perform a lookup when it
encounters an AWS CDK token, resolving it to its concrete value, and
producing a valid manifest.

The same thing can also be achieved with the CDK For Terraform, by
setting the `resolveCDKTFTokens` to `true`.

```ts
import * as tf from "cdktf";
import * as aws from "@cdktf/provider-aws";
import * as k8s from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-26';

const awsApp = new tf.App();
const stack = new tf.TerraformStack(awsApp, 'Stack');

const k8sApp = new k8s.App();
const manifest = new k8s.Chart(k8sApp, 'Manifest');

const bucket = new aws.s3Bucket.S3Bucket(stack, 'Bucket');
new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
  schedule: k8s.Cron.daily(),
  containers: [{
    image: 'job',
    envVariables: {
      // passing the bucket name via an env variable
      BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucket.bucket),
    }
 }]
});

awsApp.synth();
k8sApp.synth({ resolveCDKTFTokens: true });
```

Note that enabling this functionality means that:

1. `cdk8s synth` must be executed after the cloud resources have been provisioned.
2. `cdk8s synth` must be executed in an environment that has connectivity
and permissions to query cloud resources.

Depending on your pipelines, different workflows need to be employed in order to deploy
such applications.

## Public FAQ

### What are we launching today?

A new feature in the `cdk8s` core library that allows synthesizing cdk8s
applications that reference tokens from the AWS CDK or CDKTF frameworks.

### Why should I use this feature?

If your Kubernetes workloads rely on resources offered by a cloud provider,
you can use this new feature to define cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes
resources in the same application. You can leverage either the AWS CDK or
the CDK For Terraform for your cloud infrastructure, and seamlessly reference
it in your cdk8s application.

## Internal FAQ

### Why are we doing this?

To alleviate customer pain in defining Kubernetes applications that leverage
cloud infrastructure. Currently, synthesizing a cdk8s application that references
cloud resources will result in an invalid and un-deployable Kubernetes manifest.
Customers are therefore forced to eject from the cdk8s framework in order to implement
such applications. Some customers we've spoken to have expressed concerns with
with such an approach, and would love to see built-in support for this in cdk8s.

So, even though this feature doesn't necessarily unlock the use-case, it provides a
much better experience that can delight our customers.

In addition, adding this capability into the framework may attract Kubernetes users who
don't currently leverage the CDK ecosystem to define and deploy their workloads.

### Why should we _not_ do this?

The main reason not to do this is because there are several ways to
address the use-case without this feature. A few approaches are possible:

#### Pre Synth Query

In this approach, customers decouple the definition of cloud infrastructure from the
definition of Kubernetes resources. That is, instead of referencing `bucket.bucketName`
in the Kubernetes spec, they might extract it from an env variable via `process.env.BUCKET_NAME`.

The responsibility of populating the `BUCKET_NAME` env variable falls to an
external script that must be executed before calling `cdk8s synth`. The script will
use service API's to query for the required information.

Maintaining such a script can be complex because it requires constant coordination between two
decoupled parts of the application. Every time a new cloud resource is utilized, it needs to
be added in two places. This makes it clear that such decoupling is not natural,
and is only caused by technical limitations.

#### Pre Synth Provisioning

In this approach, the cloud infrastructure is split into two:

- One part contains independent<sup>*</sup> resources and is defined within
the IaC application (AWS CDK or CDKTF).
- The second part contains the resources being used by Kubernetes resources,
and are provisioned imperatively before synthesis, either as part of the
cdk8s application, or externally.

> <sup>*</sup> Independent with respect to usage in Kubernetes resource definitions.

This separation into imperative provisioning essentially re-introduces all
the complexity that IaC aims to solve.

#### Post Synth Query

In this approach, cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes resources are defined in the same
application using the standard IaC tooling. The Kubernetes resources are tightly coupled
with their required cloud resources. To overcome the problem of the un-deployable manifest,
Customers have to post-process the result of `cdk8s synth` to produce the final deployable
manifest. This post synthesis step inspects the manifest for references to
cloud resources, interprets them, and performs the necessary lookups.

From an application maintenance perspective, this approach is actually pretty robust.
The problem is that implementing and maintaining such a post synthesis step is not at all
trivial. This RFC essentially proposes baking this step into the cdk8s framework, so that
customers don't have to deal with the complexities it poses, outlined further down in
this RFC.

### Is this a breaking change?

No

### What alternative solutions did you consider?

#### CloudControl API

#### CfnOutput

In this solution, whenever cdk8s encounters an AWS CDK token, it will:

- If the corresponding CloudFormation output is defined, fetch its value.
- If the corresponding CloudFormation output is missing, define it.

For example, given the following definition:

```ts
new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
  schedule: k8s.Cron.daily(),
  containers: [{
    image: 'job',
    envVariables: {
      // passing the bucket name via an env variable
      BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucket.bucketName),
    }
 }]
});
```

Resolving the `bucket.bucketName` token will look something like:

```ts
// some output id generated from the token
const outputId = 'some-stable-id'

// 'stack' is the AWS CDK stack where 'bucket' is defined.
if (outputExists(stack, outputId)) {
  return fetchValue(stack, outputId)
} else {
  new CfnOutput(stack, outputId, { value: bucket.bucketName });
  return bucket.bucketName
}
```

##### Pros

- Outputs can be created for any CloudFormation attribute, which means all AWS CDK
attributes will be supported.

##### Cons

While it makes sense for the cdk8s application to depend on the AWS CDK application,
injecting these synthetic outputs also creates the reverse dependency. This is non intuitive and
has some surprising implications:

- Synthesizing the cdk8s application **must happen before** synthesizing the AWS CDK application.
Otherwise, the necessary CloudFormation outputs won't exist.
- Synthesizing the AWS CDK application separately from the cdk8s application will result in a different cloud assembly.
- The cdk8s application needs to be synthesized twice, once to add the CloudFormation outputs, and once to fetch their values. This means that the first synthesis will inherently produce an invalid manifest.
