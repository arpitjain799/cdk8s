## Working Backwards

### CHANGELOG

`feat(synth): custom resolvers`

### README

Custom resolvers are a mechanism to inject custom logic into the cdk8s value resolution process. 
It allows to transform any value just before being written to the Kubernetes manifest.

To define a custom resolver, fist create a class that implements the `ITokenResolver` interface:

```ts
import { ITokenResolver, ResolutionContext } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyCustomResolver implements ITokenResolver {

  public resolve(context: ResolutionContext, value: any): any {
    // run some custom logic
  }

}
```

Where the `context` argument contains information about the value that is 
currently being resolved:

- **obj**: `ApiObject` currently being resolved.
- **key**: Array containing the JSON path elements of they keys leading up to the value.

Then, when you create a cdk8s `Chart`, pass the resolver instance to it via the `resolver` property:

```ts
import { App, Chart } from 'cdk8s'

const app = new App();
new Chart(app, 'Chart', { resolver: new MyCustomResolver() });
```

When you run `cdk8s synth`, your custom logic will be invoked, and the return 
value will replace the original value and be written to the manifest.

For example, if you define a Kubernetes service like so:

```ts
new KubeService(this, 'Service', {
  spec: {
    type: 'LoadBalancer',
  }
});
```

Your resolver will be invoked with the following arguments:

- **context**
  - *obj*: The `KubeService` instance of type `ApiObject`.
  - *key*: `['spec', 'type']`
- **value**: `LoadBalancer`


One common use-case for this feature is to automatically resolve deploy time 
attributes of cloud resources, and pass them to your Kubernetes workloads. To that end, 
cdk8s provides a resolver for the following CDK frameworks:

#### AWS Cloud Development Kit

In this example, we create an S3 `Bucket` with the AWS CDK, and pass its (deploy time generated) name 
as an environment variable to a Kubernetes `CronJob` resource.

```ts
import * as aws from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as k8s from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-26';

import { AwsCdkTokenResolver } from '@cdk8s/aws-cdk-token-resolver';

const awsApp = new aws.App();
const stack = new aws.Stack(awsApp, 'Stack');

const resolver = new AwsCdkTokenResolver(stack);

const k8sApp = new k8s.App();
const manifest = new k8s.Chart(k8sApp, 'Manifest', { resolver });

const bucket = new aws.aws_s3.Bucket(stack, 'Bucket');

new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
  schedule: k8s.Cron.daily(),
  containers: [{
    image: 'job',
    envVariables: {
      // passing the bucket name via an env variable
      BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucket.bucketName),
    }
 }]
});

awsApp.synth();
k8sApp.synth();
```

Notice we create two applications: one for our cdk8s constructs, and one for our AWS CDK constructs.
Both are defined and synthesized in the same file, but can be separated as needed.
Since your Kubernetes resources now depend on AWS CDK deploy tokens, you'll first need to run `cdk deploy`, 
and only then `cdk8s synth`.

> Otherwise, the Kubernetes manifests will contain a string representation of the tokens (e.g `${Token[TOKEN.25]}`), 
> instead of the concrete values. To learn more AWS CDK tokens, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/tokens.html).

#### CDK For Terraform

In this example, we create an S3 `Bucket` with the CDKTF, and pass its (deploy time generated) name 
as an environment variable to a Kubernetes `CronJob` resource.

```ts
import * as tf from "cdktf";
import * as aws from "@cdktf/provider-aws";
import * as k8s from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-26';

import { CdkTfTokenResolver } from '@cdk8s/cdktf-token-resolver';

const awsApp = new tf.App();
const stack = new tf.TerraformStack(awsApp, 'Stack');

const resolver = new CdkTfTokenResolver(stack);

const k8sApp = new k8s.App();
const manifest = new k8s.Chart(k8sApp, 'Manifest', { resolver });

const bucket = new aws.s3Bucket.S3Bucket(stack, 'Bucket');

new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
  schedule: k8s.Cron.daily(),
  containers: [{
    image: 'job',
    envVariables: {
      // passing the bucket name via an env variable
      BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucket.bucket),
    }
 }]
});

awsApp.synth();
k8sApp.synth();
```

Notice we create two applications: one for our cdk8s constructs, and one for our CDKTF constructs.
Both are defined and synthesized in the same file, but can be separated as needed.
Since your Kubernetes resources now depend on CDKTF tokens, you'll first need to run `cdk deploy`, 
and only then `cdk8s synth`.

> Otherwise, the Kubernetes manifests will contain a string representation of the tokens (e.g `${TfToken[TOKEN.0]}`), 
> instead of the concrete values. To learn more CDKTF tokens, see [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf/concepts/tokens).

## Public FAQ

### What are we launching today?

This launch consists of three deliverables:

- A new feature in the `cdk8s` core library that allows injecting custom resolution logic during synthesis.
- A new package called `@cdk8s/aws-cdk-token-resolver` containing a resolver that knows to detect 
AWS CDK tokens, and fetch its concrete values from AWS.
- A new package called `@cdk8s/cdktf-token-resolver` containing a resolver that knows to detect 
CDKTF tokens, and fetch its concrete values from terraform state files.

### Why should I use this feature?

If you need to perform some sort of automatic transformation on user defined resource 
definitions, before they get written to the Kubernetes manifest.

More concretely, if your Kubernetes workloads rely on resources offered by a 
cloud provider, you can use this new feature to define cloud infrastructure 
and Kubernetes resources in the same application. You can leverage either the 
AWS CDK or the CDK For Terraform for your cloud infrastructure, and seamlessly 
reference it in your cdk8s application.

## Internal FAQ

### Why are we doing this?

It is common for Kubernetes applications to leverage cloud resources for their operation.
Those cloud resources are often defined and provisioned using other CDK frameworks, 
such as the AWS CDK or the CDKTF. Since cdk8s is built on the same technologies, and supports the 
same programming languages, it stands to reason that users would want to define both cloud and 
Kubernetes resources within the same codebase. As an example, consider a Kubernetes `CronJob` 
that needs an S3 `Bucket` to store periodic computation results.

When the bucket name is known during synthesis (by explicitly setting the name of the bucket), 
this can be achieved fairly easily, for instance using the AWS CDK:

```ts
import * as aws from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as k8s from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-26';

const k8sApp = new k8s.App();
const awsApp = new aws.App();

const stack = new aws.Stack(awsApp, 'Stack');
const manifest = new k8s.Chart(k8sApp, 'Manifest');

const bucketName = 'my-bucket';

// define the bucket with a well known name
new aws.aws_s3.Bucket(stack, 'Bucket', { bucketName });

// pass the bucket name to the CronJob container
new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
 containers: [{ 
   image: 'job',
   envVariables: {
     BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucketName),
   }
 }]
});

k8sApp.synth();
awsApp.synth();
```

This application with synthesize a proper Kubernetes manifest containing the name of bucket:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: manifest-cronjob-c86481e8
spec:
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            cdk8s.io/metadata.addr: Manifest-CronJob-c89809bc
        spec:
          containers:
            - env:
                - name: BUCKET_NAME
                  value: my-bucket
              image: job
```

However, if the bucket is not explicitly specified (as mentioned by the 
[AWS CDK best practices guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/best-practices.html)):

```ts
import * as aws from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as k8s from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-26';

const k8sApp = new k8s.App();
const awsApp = new aws.App();

const stack = new aws.Stack(awsApp, 'Stack');
const manifest = new k8s.Chart(k8sApp, 'Manifest');

// define the bucket without an explicit name
new aws.aws_s3.Bucket(stack, 'Bucket');

// pass the bucket name to the CronJob container
new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
 containers: [{ 
   image: 'job',
   envVariables: {
     BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucket.bucketName),
   }
 }]
});

k8sApp.synth();
awsApp.synth();
```

The synthesized Kubernetes manifest will not be deployable, as it will not 
contain the actual value of the bucket name, but rather a string 
representation of the AWS CDK token, *representing* the bucket name.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: manifest-cronjob-c86481e8
spec:
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            cdk8s.io/metadata.addr: Manifest-CronJob-c89809bc
        spec:
          containers:
            - env:
                - name: BUCKET_NAME
                  value: ${Token[TOKEN.603]} # whoops, no good
              image: job
```

To generate a deployable manifest, an additional lookup phase is required that will
fetch the value of the bucket name directly from AWS. Currently, customers are forced 
to implement this lookup by themselves, which presents non trivial challenges and burden. 

This feature aims to alleviate that, and make it as easy as possible to author such 
complex applications. 

### Why should we _not_ do this?

There are several mechanisms customers could implement this capability without explicit 
support from the cdk8s team. Given that, one could argue that the effort would not be 
worth the value. Following is an outline of such mechanisms:

#### Explicit Token Resolution

Instead of passing tokens directly to cdk8s, customers could explicitly fetch its 
concrete value with a `fetchAWS` function they implement:

```ts
...

// define the bucket without an explicit name
new aws.aws_s3.Bucket(stack, 'Bucket');

// fetch its name directly from AWS
const bucketName = fetchToken(bucket.bucketName);

// pass the bucket name to the CronJob container
new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
 containers: [{ 
   image: 'job',
   envVariables: {
     BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucketName),
   }
 }]
});

...
```

There are several challenges with this:

- Implementing the `fetchAWS` function is not trivial. It requires deep knowledge of 
the AWS CDK token system and must handle premature resolution (i.e when executed before deployment finishes).
- Error prone. Users may forget to call the `fetchAWS` method and mistakenly pass the token instead.
- Not idiomatic / ergonomic. It is unnatural for users to incorporate such code into CDK applications.

#### Explicit Output Resolution

Here, customers defined a `CfnOutput` for each value they would like to expose to the cdk8s application.
Those outputs are then explicitly resolved using a `fetchAWS` function they implement:

```ts
...

// define the bucket without an explicit name
new aws.aws_s3.Bucket(stack, 'Bucket');

const bucketNameOutput = new aws.CfnOutput(this, 'BucketName', {
  value: bucket.bucketName,
});

// fetch its name directly from AWS
const bucketName = fetchAWS(bucketNameOutput);

// pass the bucket name to the CronJob container
new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
 containers: [{ 
   image: 'job',
   envVariables: {
     BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucketName),
   }
 }]
});

...
```

This approach simplifies the implementation of the `fetchAWS` function because it only needs 
to detect and interpret `CfnOutput` types, and not general tokens. It also makes the calls to AWS 
simpler because it only requires a single `DescribeStack` call. However, it still isn't trivial.

In addition, the usability challenges still remain:

- Error prone. Users may forget to define and output and call the `fetchAWS` function and mistakenly pass the token instead.
- Not idiomatic / ergonomic. It is unnatural for users to incorporate such code into CDK applications.

#### Out-Of-Band Query

In this approach, customers decouple the definition of cloud infrastructure from the
definition of Kubernetes resources. That is, instead of referencing `bucket.bucketName`
in the Kubernetes spec, they might extract it from an env variable via `process.env.BUCKET_NAME`.

```ts
...

new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
 containers: [{ 
   image: 'job',
   envVariables: {
     BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(process.env.BUCKET_NAME),
   }
 }]
});

...
```

#### Out-Of-Band Provisioning

In this approach, the cloud infrastructure is split into two:

- One part contains independent<sup>*</sup> resources and is defined within
the IaC application (AWS CDK or CDKTF).
- The second part contains the resources being used by Kubernetes resources,
and are provisioned imperatively before synthesis, either as part of the
cdk8s application, or externally.

> <sup>*</sup> Independent with respect to usage in Kubernetes resource definitions.


However, this separation into imperative provisioning essentially re-introduces all
the complexity that IaC aims to solve, and is not desirable.

#### Post Synth Processing

In this approach, cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes resources are defined in the same
application using the standard IaC tooling. The Kubernetes resources are tightly coupled
with their required cloud resources. 

```ts
...

// define the bucket without an explicit name
new aws.aws_s3.Bucket(stack, 'Bucket');

// pass the bucket name to the CronJob container
new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
 containers: [{ 
   image: 'job',
   envVariables: {
     BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucket.bucketName),
   }
 }]
});

cdk8sApp.synth();

...
```

To overcome the problem of unresolved tokens, customers have to post-process the result 
of `cdk8sApp.synth()` to produce the final deployable manifest. This post synthesis 
step inspects the manifest for references to cloud resources, interprets them, 
and performs the necessary lookups.

From an application maintenance perspective, this approach is actually pretty robust.
The problem is that implementing and maintaining such a post synthesis step is not at all
trivial. This RFC essentially proposes baking this step into the cdk8s framework, so that
customers don't have to deal with the complexities it poses.

### What is the technical solution (design) of this feature?

The high-level design consists of three parts:

#### Custom Resolvers

When cdk8s applications are synthesized, the [`resolve`](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core/blob/v2.7.52/src/_resolve.ts#L3) 
function is called for every property of the user defined resource spec. Currently, it handles 
resolving instances of [`Lazy`](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core/blob/v2.7.52/src/_resolve.ts#L10) 
and [implicit tokens](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core/blob/v2.7.52/src/_resolve.ts#L16).

To allow the lookups described in this RFC, we will provide a custom resolution hook in this 
function in the form of an interface, that customers can implement:

```ts
import { ApiObject } from './api-object';

export class ResolutionContext {

  public readonly obj: ApiObject;
  public readonly key: string[];

}

export interface IResolver {

  resolve(context: ResolutionContext, value: any): any;
}
```

When a cdk8s chart is defined, a custom resolver can be passed to it:

```ts
new Chart(app, 'Chart', { resolver: new MyClassThatImplementsIResolver() })
```

During synthesis, the `resolve` function of the custom resolver will be invoked on every primitive value.
The return value of this function will replace the original value and be written into the manifest.

### Is this a breaking change?

No

### What alternative solutions did you consider?

> Briefly describe alternative approaches that you considered. If there are
> hairy details, include them in an appendix.


#### Outputs





#### CloudControl API

#### CfnOutput

In this solution, whenever cdk8s encounters an AWS CDK token, it will:

- If the corresponding CloudFormation output exists and is deployed, fetch its value.
- If the corresponding CloudFormation output is missing, define it.

For example, given the following definition:

```ts
new kplus.CronJob(manifest, 'CronJob', {
  schedule: k8s.Cron.daily(),
  containers: [{
    image: 'job',
    envVariables: {
      // passing the bucket name via an env variable
      BUCKET_NAME: kplus.EnvValue.fromValue(bucket.bucketName),
    }
 }]
});
```

Resolving the `bucket.bucketName` token will look something like:

```ts
// some output id generated from the token
const outputId = 'some-stable-id'

try {
  return fetchValue(stack, outputId)
} catch (error: OutputNotFound) {
  new CfnOutput(stack, outputId, { value: bucket.bucketName });
  // nothing else we can return here...
  return bucket.bucketName
}
```

##### Pros

- Outputs can be created for any CloudFormation attribute, which means all AWS CDK
attributes will be supported.

##### Cons

While it makes sense for the cdk8s application to depend on the AWS CDK application,
injecting these synthetic outputs also creates the reverse dependency. This is non intuitive and
has some surprising implications:

- Synthesizing the AWS CDK application **must happen after** synthesizing the cdk8s application.
Otherwise, the necessary CloudFormation outputs won't exist.
- Synthesizing the AWS CDK application separately from the cdk8s application will result in a different cloud assembly.
- The cdk8s application needs to be synthesized twice, once to add the CloudFormation outputs, and once to fetch their values. This means that the first synthesis will inherently produce an invalid manifest.

##### Decision

It is hard to pin-point exactly what challenges the above implications will impose, but their existence
can create an awkward and error prone experience. We therefore prefer avoiding them.

#### BucketDeployment

This solution is similar to the [CfnOutput](#cfnoutput) one, but instead of creating a `CfnOutput`,
we create a [`BucketDeployment`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3_deployment.BucketDeployment.html) resource. This resource allows creating a [JSON file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3_deployment.Source.html#static-jsonwbrdataobjectkey-obj) that supports deploy time values. This file can contain the token value and can be downloaded by cdk8s during synthesis.

##### Pros

- The JSON file can contain any token, which means all AWS CDK attributes will be supported.
- Only a single resource is added to the AWS CDK application, as opposed to multiple outputs.
- During cdk8s synthesis, only a single network call is needed to download the file, as opposed
to multiple ones for fetching the outputs.

##### Cons

The cons remain exactly the same as the [ones](#cons) from the `CfnOutput` solution.

##### Decision

The benefits of this solution over the outputs solution are not strong enough
to overcome the cons, so it is rejected on the same account.
